# ESPX - Project #1

A producers-consumers algorithm using pthreads and a FIFO queue.

## **1. Execution**
In order to test the implementation locally on your machine, use the files located in the home directory. Follow the commands in the order given below:

```
make all
./prod-cons <p> <q>
```
Replase the values <p> and <q> with the producer and consumer threads you want to use respectively. For example,
  
```
./prod-cons 2 3
```
will run the program with 2 producer threads and 3 consumer threads.
